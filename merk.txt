User selects some items

instances:
  { bpy-obj -> (id, geometry-id, node-id)

geometries:
  { bpy-obj -> id }
nodes:
  { bpy-obj -> id }

exporting props orientation preserving:
  - convert the vertex data by rotating -90deg
  - use an origin rotated by 90deg
  - rotation pose stays same
  - translation pose needs to swap
  - scale pose stays same

create a plan:
  start:
    list of objects -> scene-subset
      object links to 1 mesh
      object links to 1 node
      object has pose
    list of meshes (geometries) -> data-file
      mesh has name
      mesh has uvs
    list of mesh-nodes -> data-file
      node has name
    list of uvs -> data-file
      uvset has name
